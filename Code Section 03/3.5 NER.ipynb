    "In economics, inflation (or less frequently, price inflation) is a general rise in the price level in an economy over a period of time, resulting in a sustained drop in the purchasing power of money. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index, usually the consumer price index, over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists generally believe that very high rates of inflation and hyperinflation are harmful, and are caused by an excessive growth of the money supply. Views on which factors determine low to moderate rates of inflation are more varied. Low or moderate inflation may be attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services, or changes in available supplies such as during scarcities. However, the consensus view is that a long sustained period of inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation affects economies in various positive and negative ways. The negative effects of inflation include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings, and if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. Positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity, allowing the central bank more leeway in carrying out monetary policy, encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most economists favor a low and steady rate of inflation. Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities. Generally, these monetary authorities are the central banks that control monetary policy through the setting of interest rates, through open market operations, and through the setting of banking reserve requirements.\n",

    "Silver purity through time in early Roman imperial silver coins. To increase the number of silver coins in circulation while short on silver, the Roman imperial government repeatedly debased the coins. They melted relatively pure silver coins and then struck new silver coins of lower purity but of nominally equal value. Silver coins were relatively pure before Nero (AD -), but by the s had hardly any silver left.\n",
    "Colored dice with checkered background\n",
    "The silver content of Roman silver coins rapidly declined during the Crisis of the Third Century.\n",
    "Rapid increases in the quantity of money or in the overall money supply have occurred in many different societies throughout history, changing with different forms of money used. For instance, when silver was used as currency, the government could collect silver coins, melt them down, mix them with other metals such as copper or lead and reissue them at the same nominal value, a process known as debasement. At the ascent of Nero as Roman emperor in AD , the denarius contained more than % silver, but by the s hardly any silver was left. By diluting the silver with other metals, the government could issue more coins without increasing the amount of silver used to make them. When the cost of each coin is lowered in this way, the government profits from an increase in seigniorage. This practice would increase the money supply but at the same time the relative value of each coin would be lowered. As the relative value of the coins becomes lower, consumers would need to give more coins in exchange for the same goods and services as before. These goods and services would experience a price increase as the value of each coin is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Song Dynasty China introduced the practice of printing paper money to create fiat currency. During the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, the government spent a great deal of money fighting costly wars, and reacted by printing more money, leading to inflation. Fearing the inflation that plagued the Yuan dynasty, the Ming Dynasty initially rejected the use of paper money, and reverted to using copper coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, large infusions of gold or silver into an economy has also led to inflation. During the Malian king Mansa Musa's hajj to Mecca in , he was reportedly accompanied by a camel train that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels. When he passed through Cairo, he spent or gave away so much gold that it depressed its price in Egypt for over a decade, causing high inflation. A contemporary Arab historian remarked about Mansa Musa's visit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gold was at a high price in Egypt until they came in that year. The mithqal did not go below  dirhams and was generally above, but from that time its value fell and it cheapened in price and has remained cheap till now. The mithqal does not exceed  dirhams or less. This has been the state of affairs for about twelve years until this day by reason of the large amount of gold which they brought into Egypt and spent there \n",
    "\n",
    "— Chihab Al-Umari, Kingdom of Mali\n",
    "From the second half of the th century to the first half of the th, Western Europe experienced a major inflationary cycle referred to as the \"price revolution\", with prices on average rising perhaps sixfold over  years. This was largely caused by the sudden influx of gold and silver from the New World into Habsburg Spain. The silver spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe and caused widespread inflation. Demographic factors also contributed to upward pressure on prices, with European population growth after depopulation caused by the Black Death pandemic.\n",

    "US historical inflation and deflation (in green) from the mid-th century to the end of the th.\n",
    "By the nineteenth century, economists categorized three separate factors that cause a rise or fall in the price of goods: a change in the value or production costs of the good, a change in the price of money which then was usually a fluctuation in the commodity price of the metallic content in the currency, and currency depreciation resulting from an increased supply of currency relative to the quantity of redeemable metal backing the currency. Following the proliferation of private banknote currency printed during the American Civil War, the term \"inflation\" started to appear as a direct reference to the currency depreciation that occurred as the quantity of redeemable banknotes outstripped the quantity of metal available for their redemption. At that time, the term inflation referred to the devaluation of the currency, and not to a rise in the price of goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship between the over-supply of banknotes and a resulting depreciation in their value was noted by earlier classical economists such as David Hume and David Ricardo, who would go on to examine and debate what effect a currency devaluation (later termed monetary inflation) has on the price of goods (later termed price inflation, and eventually just inflation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The adoption of fiat currency by many countries, from the th century onwards, made much larger variations in the supply of money possible. Rapid increases in the money supply have taken place a number of times in countries experiencing political crises, producing hyperinflations – episodes of extreme inflation rates much higher than those observed in earlier periods of commodity money. The hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic of Germany is a notable example. Currently, the hyperinflation in Venezuela is the highest in the world, with an annual inflation rate of ,% as of October .\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since the s, inflation has been held low and stable in countries with strong independent central banks. This has led to a moderation of the business cycle and a reduction in variation in most macroeconomic indicators - an event known as the Great Moderation.\n",

    "و عبد الله محمد بن موسى الخوارزمي عالم رياضيات وفلك وجغرافيا مسلم. يكنى باسم الخوارزمي وأبي جعفر. قيل أنه ولد حوالي 164هـ 781م (وهو غير مؤكد) وقيل أنه توفي بعد 232 هـ أي (بعد 847م). يعتبر من أوائل علماء الرياضيات المسلمين حيث ساهمت أعماله بدور كبير في تقدم الرياضيات في عصره. اتصل بالخليفة العباسي المأمون وعمل في بيت الحكمة في بغداد وكسب ثقة الخليفة إذ ولاه المأمون بيت الحكمة كما عهد إليه برسم خارطة للأرض عمل فيها أكثر من سبعين جغرافيا. قبل وفاته في 850 م/232 هـ كان الخوارزمي قد ترك العديد من المؤلفات في علوم الرياضيات والفلك والجغرافيا ومن أهمها كتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة الذي يعد أهم كتبه.\n",
    "\n",
    "ترجم الكتابَ إلى اللغة اللاتينية حوالي عام 1145 م العالم روبرت مِن تشستر. دخلت على إثر ذلك كلمات مثل الجبر Algebra والصفر Zero إلى اللغات اللاتينية وترجمه بعد ذلك بقليل جيراردو الكريموني الساكن في طليطلة، متبوعا في ذلك بترجمة ثالثة قام بها الإيطالي غيوم دي لونا. استُعملت ترجمة روبرت مِن تشستر الكتاب الرئيسي في الرياضيات إلى حدود القرن السادس عشر في الجامعات الأوروبية.\n",
    "\n",
    "ضمت مؤلفات الخوارزمي كتاب الجمع والتفريق في الحساب الهندي، وكتاب رسم الربع المعمور، وكتاب تقويم البلدان، وكتاب العمل بالأسطرلاب، وكتاب \"صورة الأرض \" الذي اعتمد فيه على كتاب المجسطي لبطليموس مع إضافات وشروح وتعليقات، وأعاد كتابة كتاب الفلك الهندي المعروف باسم \"السند هند الكبير\" الذي ترجم إلى اللغة العربية زمن الخليفة المنصور فأعاد الخوارزمي كتابته وأضاف إليه وسمي كتابه \"السند هند الصغير\".\n",
    "\n",
    "وقد عرض في كتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة أول حل منهجي للمعادلات الخطية والمعادلات التربيعية مستعملا في ذلك الطريقة المعروفة باسم إكمال المربع. ويعتبر مؤسس علم الجبر، (اللقب الذي يتقاسمه مع ديوفانتوس) في القرن الثاني عشر، ولقد قدمت ترجمات اللاتينية عن حسابه على الأرقام الهندية، النظام العشري إلى العالم الغربي. نقح الخوارزمي كتاب الجغرافيا لكلاوديوس بطليموس وكتب في علم الفلك والتنجيم.\n",
    "\n",
    "كان لإسهاماته تأثير كبير في اللغة. \"فالجبر\"، هو أحد من اثنين من العمليات اللائي استخدمهن في حلحلة المعادلات التربيعية. وفي اللغة الإنجليزية كلمة Algorism وalgorithm تنبعان من Algoritmi، الشكل اللاتيني لاسمه. واسمه هو أصل الكلمة في اللغة الإسبانية guarismo والبرتغالية algarismo وهما الاثنان بمعنى \"رقم\".\n",

    "انتقلت عائلته من مدينة خوارزم في إقليم خراسان الإسلامي (والتي تسمى ’’خيوا‘‘ في العصر الحالي، في جمهورية أوزبكستان) إلى بغداد. وأنجز الخوارزمي معظم أبحاثه بين عامي 813م و833م في دار الحكمة في بغداد، التي أسسها الخليفة المأمون، حيث عينه المأمون على رأس خزانة كتبه، وعهد إليهِ بجمع الكتب اليونانية وترجمتها. وقد استفاد الخوارزمي من الكتب التي كانت متوفرة في خزانة المأمون فدرس الرياضيات والجغرافية والفلك والتاريخ، إضافةً إلى إحاطته بالمعارف اليونانية والهندية. نشر كل أعماله باللغة العربية، التي كانت لغة العلم في ذلك العصر. ويسميه الطبري في تاريخه: محمد بن موسى الخوارزمي القطربلّي، نسبة إلى قرية قُطْربُلّ من ضواحي بغداد. وبدأ الخوارزمي كتابه (الجبر والمقابلة) بالبسملة (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم). وبالرغم من عدم إجماع المصادر التأريخية والموسوعات العلمية على هويته الا ان الموسوعة البريطانية (نسخة الطلاب الأطفال) وموسوعة مايكروسوفت إنكارتا وموسوعة جامعة كولومبيا تقول أنه عربي، بينما تذكر مصادر أخرى أنه فارسي أو تركي. وفي الإصدار العام للموسوعة البريطانية ذكر أنه \"عالم مسلم\" من دون تحديد قوميته ،وفي كتاب الفهرس لابن النديم، توجد سيرة ذاتية قصيرة للخوارزمي، مع قائمة الكتب التي كتبها. ولقد أنجز الخوارزمي معظم أعماله في الفترة ما بين عامي 813 و833. وبعد الفتح الإسلامي لبلاد فارس، أصبحت بغداد مركز الدراسات العلمية والتجارية، وأتى إليها العديد من التجار والعلماء من مناطق بعيدة مثل الصين والهند، كما فعل الخوارزمي. وكان يعمل في بغداد، وهو باحث في بيت الحكمة الذي أنشأه الخليفة المأمون، حيث درس العلوم والرياضيات، والتي تضمنت ترجمة المخطوطات اليونانية والسنسكريتية العلمية وغيرها.\n",
    "\n",
    "يقترح راشد رشدي: ليست هناك حاجة إلى أن يكون خبيرًا في هذه الفترة أو عالم فيزياء لمعرفة أن الاقتباس الثاني من الطبري ينبغي أن يقرأ \"محمد بن موسى الخوارزمي والمجيري القطربولي\"، وأن هناك شخصان (الخوارزمي) و المجيسي القطبوبولي) تم حذف الـ [و] بينهما في نسخة مبكرة. لا يجدر ذكر ذلك إذا لم يتم ارتكاب سلسلة من الأخطاء المتعلقة بشخصية الخوارزمي، وأحيانًا حتى أصول علمه. في الآونة الأخيرة، جيرالد تومر... بثقة ساذجة شيد خيالًا كاملاً حول الخطأ الذي لا يمكن إنكاره فقط لمجرد إمتاع القارئ.\n",
    "\n",
    "فيما يتعلق بدين الخوارزمي، كتب تومر: يبدو أن هناك مقولة أخرى قدمها له الجباري، \"المجوسي\"، تشير إلى أنه كان من أتباع الديانة الزرادشتية القديمة. كان من الممكن أن يكون هذا ممكنًا في ذلك الوقت لرجل من أصل إيراني، لكن المقدمة التقية لجبر الخوارزمي تُظهر أنه مسلم، لذلك فإن تعبير آل جابر لا يمكن أن يعني أكثر من ذلك أسلافه، وربما هو في شبابه، كان من الزرادشتيين.\n",
    "\n",
    "إسهاماته\n",
    "ساهم الخوارزمي في الرياضيات والجغرافيا وعلم الفلك وعلم الخرائط، وأرسى الأساس للابتكار في الجبر وعلم المثلثات. وأسلوبه المنهجي في حل المعادلات الخطية والمعادلات التربيعية أدى إلى الجبر، وهي كلمة مشتقة من عنوان كتابه حول هذا الموضوع، المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة.\n",
    "\n",
    "كتاب الجمع والتفريق بحساب الهند سنة 825 م، حيث كان مسؤولا بشكل أساسي عن نشر نظام الترقيم الهندي في جميع أنحاء الشرق الأوسط وأوروبا.\n",
    "\n",
    "وترجمت الكلمة (خوارزم) إلى اللغة اللاتينية Algoritmi de numero Indorum. من لقبهِ الخوارزمي، حيث أتت الكلمة اللاتينية Algoritmi، التي أدت إلى شيوع مصطلح \"الخوارزمية\".\n",
    "\n",
    "ولقد نظم الخوارزمي وصحح بيانات بطليموس عن أفريقيا والشرق الأوسط. ومن كتبه الرئيسية كتاب \"صورة الأرض\"، الذي يقدم فيه إحداثيات الأماكن التي تستند على جغرافية بطليموس ولكن مع تحسن القيم للبحر الأبيض المتوسط وآسيا وأفريقيا. كما كتب أيضا عن الأجهزة الفلكية مثل الأسطرلاب، والمزولة.\n",
